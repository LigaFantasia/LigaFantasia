<h1>Liga Fantasía</h1>
Liga Fantasía it's an amateur league to play for fun. What makes it unique is it's coin system. To balance teams and give players reasons to compete, the league has a fantasy coin. 
We select 8 managers from all the people interested, these managers receive the same coins, from this point is up to the managers to invest in higher ranked players, make lower players improve and increase their value, etc.

<h2>Why do we need Riot's API?</h2>

We weren't expecting that many players interested in the league (+200) and we planned doing everything manually. We can't keep doing this manually at this point so we really need Riot's API to update player's profiles with their current ranks.

This is all taken from Google Sheets:

Right now we have a functional code to make SoloQ rank update automatically, however with more than 100 players it's impossible to load all of them in a row due to the limit of the API.

<h2>Why Google Sheets?</h2>
Since this is a project made by 4 people having all the databases in google's drive was a very good decision, we know we have the knowledge to make it work perfectly in the site.

It's easy to view and share.
It's easy to modify between 4 people.
All the Add-Ons give crazy oportunities.
We use Drive for everything, so Google Sheets was the best idea.

<h2>What else can we do?</h2>

We're looking to get the Tournament keys as well so we can manage all the data from the League's matches, decide MVPs, add all the player's data to their profile, etc.
We have good plans for the future, and it's all for the players, we're getting nothing from this. 

We want the players to have the best experience, and we need Riot's API to do that.
